<h1 align="center">sscan Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps sscan module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>Converted to EPICS 3.14.  Currently saveData runs on vxWorks only. 
<li><p>Docs updated and moved to sscan/documentation
<li><p>saveData - added iocsh support; changed number
of data points from short to long int, to support
very large scans.  The data file format is unchanged, however,
because the number of points was already being written as a four-byte
quantity.
<li><p>sscanRecord - Number of points in a scan is essentially limited only by
available memory.  save-restored value of NPTS is now checked against MPTS.
Array mode (ACQT="1D ARRAY") was broken.  (The change from ACQM="ARRAYS" to
ACQT="1D ARRAY" wasn't done correctly.)
<p>Previously, the sscan record's response to an abort request (.EXSC=0) while
no scan was in progress (.BUSY==0) was to return nonzero from special(), and
EPICS tolerated this without comment.  Now it signals an error to the client.
But we don't (always?) want this action to be regarded as an error.  For now,
the scan database just declines to abort a sscan record that isn't busy, but
clients writing directly to the sscan record directly can still get this
error message.
<li><p>recDynLink - Fixed memory leak (epicsMutex created but not destroyed).
Switched communication with link tasks from ring buffer to message queue.
recDynOut was calling ca_pend_event, which used to flush the ca buffer, but
evidently no longer does; replaced with ca_flush_io.
<li><p>saveData_settings.req - new file.
<li><p>scan_settings.req - added fields ACQT and ACQM.
</ul>
